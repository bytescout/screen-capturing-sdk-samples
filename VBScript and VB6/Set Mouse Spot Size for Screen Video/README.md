' IMPORTANT: if you want to check for some code if need to stop the recording then make sure you are 
' using Thread.Sleep(1) inside the checking loop, so you have the loop like
' Do 
' Thread.Sleep(1) 
' While StopButtonNotClicked

' wait for 15 seconds (15000 msec)
WScript.Sleep(15000)

' stop capturing
capturer.Stop()

' destroy Capturer object so the video will be saved into the disk
Set capturer = Nothing
